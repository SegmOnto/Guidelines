## Zones/Regions

- Main area (text column*2): In this manuscript, we have two main areas, one for each column. 
- Ornamented initial, Historiated initial
- running title (when the title runs over two folios, should there not be two distinct areas : eg. running title recto and verso)

## Lines

- Default / main / column1/2
- Rubric
- Initial ?
- Numbering

## challenge
 How to handle zones inside zone : eg. Initial in main zone or rubric as latin or greek citations inside the main area.
