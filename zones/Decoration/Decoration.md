## Subtypes

* `Decoration:illustration`
* `Decoration:ornamentation`

## Justification

Many sources contain either originally or from additions various element of decoration.

## Problems and challenges

- Should different kinds of decorations be distinguishedÂ ?
- What do we do with Muzerelle's distinction between illustration and ornementation (being the two different kinds of decorations), cf. http://codicologia.irht.cnrs.fr/theme/liste_theme/511 ?
