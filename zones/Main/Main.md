## Definition

**Main area (text column)**: the main area designed to contain text, either as a single  or several columns (as designed in the conception of the layout: including eventually text, music notations, illumination, etc.).

## Justification

The most essential type, caracterising the most central element of the page.

## Problems and challenges

In the case of layout with several columns, the use of a single type can create problems with some implementations of layout analysis algorithms, especially if their is a non empty intersection of the zones. 
A temporary workaround could be to use different types, e.g. column1, column2, column3…
