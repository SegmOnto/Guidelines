# `Main`

## Definition

**Main area (text column)**: the main area designed to contain text, either as a single  or several columns (as designed in the conception of the layout: including eventually text, music notations, illumination, etc.).

## Subtypes

Suggested values include:

- `Main#1`
- `Main#2`
- `Main#3`

## Justification

The most essential type, caracterising the most central element of the page.


In the case of layout with several columns, the use of a single type can create problems with some implementations of layout analysis algorithms, especially if their is a non empty intersection of the zones, hence the subtypes.
