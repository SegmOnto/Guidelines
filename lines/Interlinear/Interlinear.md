# `Interlinear`

## Definition

**Interlinear:** characterises a line that is not a standard text line, but as been added between two of them, for instance to include a forgotten word.

## Examples

<img src="btv1b6000371s_f21_inter.jpg" height="100px">

## Subtypes

Suggested values include:

- `Interlinear:commentary`
- `Interlinear:correction`


## Justification

Interlinear corrections are fairly common, and not part of the original reading order of line succession. They usually need to be reintegrated somewhere inside a default line.
